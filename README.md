# About me

My name is Cheung Yau Shing Jonathan and I am a Year 2 Computer Science Student from The University of Hong Kong 

This repository contains different deep learning models I have worked on as a part-time student research assistant

I have also included my handwritten notes and comments in this repository 

Models are trained on the HKU GPU farm
